A place I will be storing my class projects as I learn new programming languages.

My first project is a unit converter I created in JAVA. This will convert from Imperial to Metric and from Metric to Imperial.


(User Guide)
The user will choose the type of conversion they want to perform (length, weight, or volume) by entering a number (1, 2, or 3). -Specific Conversion Choice: For each type of conversion, the user will specify the specific conversion direction (e.g., meters to feet or feet to meters) by entering a number (1 or 2). -Value to Convert: The user will enter the numeric value they want to convert (e.g., 10 meters).The program starts by greeting the user and displaying a menu for selecting the type of conversion. The user makes a choice, and the program captures this choice using a Scanner object.

Based on the user's selection, the program calls a specific method to handle the chosen conversion type (length, weight, or volume). -The program uses predefined methods to perform the conversion based on the user's inputs. These methods contain the necessary mathematical formulas to convert between units.

The program calculates the converted value and displays the result to the user in a readable format.
• The outputs of the program are the results of the conversions. Length, weight and volume results. 

For example
If the user chooses to convert meters to feet, the program will display a message like "X meters is Y feet."
If the user chooses to convert pounds to kilograms, the program will display a message like "X pounds is Y kilograms."
If the user chooses to convert liters to gallons, the program will display a message like "X liters is Y gallons."
